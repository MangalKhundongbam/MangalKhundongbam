## Hi there 🤙

I'm a Full-Stack Developer specializing in high-performance microservices and Natural Language Processing. I bridge the gap between sleek frontends and distributed backend architectures.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Scaling an asynchronous multi-language translation engine and optimizing NLP pipelines.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced subword tokenization with **SentencePiece** and refining custom **spaCy** models for **NER** and **POS tagging**.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Open-source FastAPI microservices or innovative NLP/Machine Learning projects.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** **Next.js**, **FastAPI**, **Celery** workers, and distributed task queues.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [Insert LinkedIn Link]
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I believe every heavy computation belongs in a background worker.

### 🏗️ Microservices Architecture
I prefer a **"FastAPI-First"** approach combined with distributed task queues to ensure scalability and reliability:

* **API Layer:** **FastAPI** for high-performance, type-safe endpoints and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
* **Task Layer:** **Celery + Redis** for reliable background processing of heavy Translation and NLP workloads.
* **UI Layer:** **Next.js** for a reactive, server-side rendered (SSR) user experience.
* **Containerization:** **Docker**-based deployments to ensure consistent environments across the stack.

### 🧠 Deep Dive: NLP Engineering
I focus on the "Deep Backend" of language processing:
* **Tokenization:** Implementing **SentencePiece** for robust, vocabulary-independent text splitting.
* **Linguistic Analysis:** Architecting **spaCy** pipelines for real-time **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Part-of-Speech (POS)** tagging.
* **Distributed Processing:** Offloading heavy inference and translation tasks to asynchronous workers to keep the UI lightning-fast.
